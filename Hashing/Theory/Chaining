Open Hashing
Hash Function: h(x)=x%10
Keys inserted at Hash Table.
A node is created and the value is inserted.
If multiple entries in a Index, keys inserted in sorted order at the same index.
Hash Table is made up of array of Linked lists or array of chains.
If you want to search for an element do [element%10] and then go that index and search for the element.
The index is found by passing element through the Hash function.
n=Number of total elements.
[n/(size of table)]=Lamda(Loading Factor)
Analysis of Hashing done on the basis of Loading factor.
We assume the keys are distributed in uniform factor.
Time taken(Average):
Successful Search t = [1 + (Lamda)/2]
Unsuccessful Search t = [1 + (Lamda)]
Select Hash function such that keys are uniformly distributed.
