Hash Functions
Selected such the values should be uniformly distributed in a Hash Table.
1. Mod h(x)= (x % size) + 1 //Better we take size= prime number
2. MidSquare 
Take square of the number and take the middle digit.
3. Folding
Partiotion the key into parts
And add the digits to make a single digits
Then use them for finding Index in Hash Table.
Again, Folding is useful for if key is a String, then we convert them into Index with the help of the ASCII codes.
Hash function should always give you the same index while storing and searching.
