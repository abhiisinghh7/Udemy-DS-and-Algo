n- Degree of a Tree
Remember: Degree of a Tree is predefined.
Strict n-ary Tree
Every node has 0 or n children.
Height vs Nodes
For 'm' degree Tree
For Height h:
Minimum Nodes n = m*h+1
Maximum Nodes n = [(m^(h+1)-1)/(m+1)]
For n Nodes:
Minimum Height= {log(base m)[n*(m-1)+1]}-1
Maximum Height= (n-1)/m
Internal vs External Nodes
EXternal Nodes = (m-1)Internal Nodes + 1
