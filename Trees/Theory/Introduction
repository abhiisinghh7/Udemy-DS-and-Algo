Tree is a collection of node, vertices and edges.
If there are n vertices then there will be (n-1) edges.
Every node has a edge coming from a parent except the root.
Terminology:
1)Root: First node of the top of tree
2)Parent: Those nodes which have an edge from top to down have nodes below them.
3)Child: Those descendents connected from top
4)Siblings: Children of same parent
5)Descendents: All those nodes which can be reached from a particular node.
6)Ancestors: All those nodes intermediate to a particular node and the root of the tree.
7)Degree of a Node: The number of direct children of a node.
8)Degree of a Tree: It is predefined. Mininum possible value of degree of the Tree is the maximum possible value of degree of a node in the tree.
9)Internal/External Nodes: Also known as Leaf/Non-Leaf nodes. Nodes with Degree=0 are called Leaf nodes or External Nodes or Terminal nodes.
Rest of nodes are called eith Non-Leaf or Internal nodes.
10)Levels: Starts from root(level 1) wrt Nodes. Children of root are level 2 and so on. We check it horizontally.
11)Height of a Tree: We count edges starting from root where Height = 0. 
12)Forest: Collection of Trees.
