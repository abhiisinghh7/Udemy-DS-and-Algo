Types of Rotation:
1)L  1 Rotation
Deletion from RHS
Imbalance from LHS
Left child of the imbalanced node, bf=1

2)L -1 Rotation
Deletion from RHS
Imbalance from LHS
Left child of the imbalanced node, bf=-1
L-R  rotation is performed.

3)L  0 Rotation
Either L1 or L(-1) rotation
Deletion from RHS
Imbalance from LHS
Left child of the imbalanced node, bf=0

Rest are mirror images of the rotations above.

4)R  1 Rotation
5)R -1 Rotation
6)R  0 Rotation
