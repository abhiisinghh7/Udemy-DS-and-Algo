We get a tracing tree from analysing a Binary Search.
Best case: (Min)= O(1)
Worst case: (Max)= O(log n)
For Average case analysis: 
Total time taken in all possible cases = sigma(i=1 to i=log n)[i*(2^i)]
Total cases = n
Average time case = log n 
E = I + 2n 
E->Edges, I->Sum of the path of all internal nodes, n-> Number of nodes
Square nodes indicate unsucessful search.
e = 1+ i
e= Number of external nodes
i= Number of internal nodes
Average(n) for sucessfull= 1 + (I/n) 
Average(n) for unsucessfull= [E/(n + 1)]
E= n(log n)
