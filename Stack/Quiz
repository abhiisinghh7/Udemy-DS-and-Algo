Question 1:
The following sequence of operations is performed on a stack:
PUSH (10), PUSH (20), POP, PUSH (10), PUSH(20), POP, POP, POP, PUSH (20), POP 
The sequence of values popped out is:
Answer: 20,20,10,10,20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2:
Which of the following permutations can be obtained in the output (in the same order) using a stack assuming that the input is the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in that order?
Answer: 3,4,5,2,1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3:
The postfix expression for the infix expression 
A + B * (C + D)/F + D * E is
Answer :ABCD+*F/+DE*+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4:
Which of the following is essential for converting an infix expression to the post fix form efficiently?
Answer: An Operator Stack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5:
Let S be a stack of size n ≥ 1. Starting with the empty stack, suppose we push the first n natural numbers in sequence, and then perform n pop operations. Assume that Push and Pop operation take X seconds each, and Y seconds elapse between the end of one such stack operation and the start of the next operation. For m ≥ 1, define the stack-life of m is the time elapsed from the end of push(m) to the start of the pop operation that removes m from S. The average stack-life of an element of this stack is
Answer :n(X + Y) - X
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6:
A single array A[1...MAXSIZE] is used to implement two stacks. The two stacks grow from opposite ends of the array. Variables top1 and top2 (top1 < top2) point to the location of the topmost element in each of the stacks. If the space is to be used efficiently, the condition for "stack full"is
Answer: top 1 = top 2 - 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Question 7:
Assume that the operators +, -, × are left associative and  ^ is right associative. The order of precedence (from highest to lowest) is ^, × , +, -. The postfix expression corresponding to the infix expression a+b ×  c - d^ e^ f is
Answer :abc×+def^^-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8:
The following postfix expression with single digit operands in evaluated using a stack
8 2 3 ^ / 2 3* + 5 1*-
Note that ^ is the exponentiation operator. The top two elements of the stack after the first * is evaluated are
Answer : 6,1
