Similar to Bin Sort
Decimal number system has 0-9 digits.
So, 0-9 bins are enough for sorting.
Eg. If octal numbers, 0-8 bins are enough.
Scan through list of elements.
Check last digit of number and drop it in that corresponding bin.
A[i]%10
Scan through all the bins and extract the numbers in FIFO manner.
Again, scan through all the numbers and drop them in bins.
This time, drop on the basis of 2nd digit or at Tens place.
A[i]%100
This procedure again repeats for the digit at the next place.
Finally, extract the elements from all bins and you will get the sorted order.
Time has increased as the number of passes has increased proportional to the maximum number of digits.
Only, little extra space is required.
Time = O(n) 
Insert and delete functions should take double pointer to a location in bins.
