Extension of Insertion Sort.
Elements are inserted distanced apart.
gap= {floor[n/2]} where n is the number of elements
We compare the 1st element and the element at position (gap) placed after the 1st element(can be multiple).
Switch them if the later element is greater.
At next pass, New gap= {floor[(previous gap)/2]}
At each pass, compare element with all the elements at the previous step element.
Total elements scanned= n elements
No. of passes = [log{base 2}n]
Total elements scanned = (n*log{base 2}n)
Shell Sort useful for scanning very large lists.
If gap selected as prime numbers, analysed as O[n^(3/2)] or O[n^(5/3)]
In place sorting-Doesn't take extra space.
This algorithm is adaptive.
Comparison based Sorting.
