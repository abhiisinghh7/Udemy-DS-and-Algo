Array name as count.
Size equal to the largest ekement in the unsorted array.
Initialize the array elements to zero.
Scan through all the elements in the array.
Whichever element is present, increment the index of respective element by one in count array.
The number of times a digit is appearing, we have wriiten at the corresponding index.
Copy all elements from count array back to original Array.
Scan count array, if index value non-zero, copy the index in the original array and decrement the value at the index.
Linear time taking algorithm.
Space taking algorithm.
Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity: Extra space for a new Array.
