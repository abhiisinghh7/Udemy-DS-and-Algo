We select a position.
Then we scan for the respective element(minimum).
Then we interchange the elements. 
In 1st pass, we got the smallest element in the list sorted.
Similarly, for rest of the passes.
We select a position and scan the list for the suitable element at that particular position.
In every pass, only a single swap.
Number of Comparisons =[n(n-1)/2] = O(n^2)
Number of Swaps =(n-1) = O(n)
NOT Adaptive Algorithm
not Stable Algorithm- It swaps the element irrespective if there is an identical element in the list.
Only Algrothm which sorts the element with minimum number of swaps.
If I perform k passes, we get k smallest element.
