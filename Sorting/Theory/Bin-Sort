Bucket/Bin Sort
Similar to count sort.
An extra array size equal to the largest element present.
That array initialized to NULL.
Scan original array.
Drop the element in the particular index
Every index is a 'bin' or 'bucket' and insert the element.
Indirectly, we create an array of linked list.
Empty the original array.
Scan array of bins and delete element and insert in the original array.
If already empty, then move to next index.
Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = Extra space for Array of Linked list and the nodes.
