Start from last element, if greater, shift the element to the right by 1 space.
Find where it's appropriate position and insert.
Time Taken= O(1)~O(n)
Assume, 1st element is sorted. Remaining elements take out from the Array and insert in the sorted list.
Number of Passes = (n-1) 
Number of Comparisons = [n(n-1)/2] = O(n^2)
Number of Swaps = [n(n-1)/2] = O(n^2)
If list already sorted,
Number of Comparisons = O(n)
Number of Swaps = O(1)
Adaptive Algorithm(By nature)
Stable Algorithm- It doesn't shift the element if it is equal
