Every character has codes that every electronic device supports.
ASCII characters for english language: 65:A - 90:Z, 97:a - 122-z
Unicodes symbols: 48:0 - 57:9  
Total 128 ASCII codes. Total 7 bits are required to represent them.
char temp; //Takes 1 byte of memory
temp = 'A';
Inside memory value of ASCII code is stored.
printf("%d",temp); //Will print A
printf("%c",temp); //Will print 65
cout<<temp; //Print A
String of characters:
char X[5]; //Declaration
char X[] = {'A','B','C','D','E'}; // Declaration and Initialization
char X[] = {65,66,67,68,69}; // Declaration and Initialization
char name[10]= {'J','O','H','N'};
char name[10]= {'J','O','H','N','\0'};
char name[]= {'J','O','H','N','\0'};
char name[]= "John";
char *n = "John";//This is a created inside heap whereas n is a pointer created inside stack pointing at the string location in the heap.
To print a String:
char name[10]= {'J','O','H','N','\0'};
printf("%s",name); //Stops beacuse of '\0'
scanf("%s",name); //Writes '\0' and automatically stores it.
scanf only reads one string meaning a single word and not multiple words string.
Continous spaces are called 'Whitespaces'.
gets(name); //Reads string with multiple words.
How to check if a string is a Palindrome:
1) Reverse
2) Compare
Setting the bit 'on' in memory is called as Merging.
Checking if the bit is 'on' or 'off' is called Masking.
Anagrams are 2 sets of strings formed using same sets of alphabets.
State Space Tree- Which shows us all the combinations and the leaves are the results.
Backtracking- Going back and taking other possible routes.
Brute Force- Finding out all possible permutations.
We have to use Recursion for Backtracking and with the help of Backtracking we are performing Brute Force.
